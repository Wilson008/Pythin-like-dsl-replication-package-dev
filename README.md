# Python-like DSL Replication Package
Replication package for the paper _Creating Python-style Domain Specific Languages - Approaches, Intermediate Results and Challenges_.

## Data & analysis scripts

* `/D:\02.Git Repository\Pythin-like-dsl-replication-package-dev\PythonicDSL\DemoDSL`
	- This is the DSL for lightweight embedded system architechture description. 
* `/D:\02.Git Repository\Pythin-like-dsl-replication-package-dev\PythonicDSL\org.xtext.grammaroptimization`
	- This a small script/plugin for automating the adaptation in concrete syntax (i.e., xtext file).
* `/D:\02.Git Repository\Pythin-like-dsl-replication-package-dev\PythonicDSL\Python-like-CSM`
	- Apply this approach to DSL CSM.
* `/D:\02.Git Repository\Pythin-like-dsl-replication-package-dev\PythonicDSL\Python-like-Jess`
	- Apply this approach to DSL Jess.
* `/D:\02.Git Repository\Pythin-like-dsl-replication-package-dev\PythonicDSL\Python-like-Xenia`
	- Apply this approach to DSL Xenia.
	
Some important folders in the whole structure:
* `/D:\02.Git Repository\Pythin-like-dsl-replication-package-dev\PythonicDSL\DemoDSL\model` 
	- This is where you could find the metamodel.
* `/D:\02.Git Repository\Pythin-like-dsl-replication-package-dev\PythonicDSL` 
	- This is where you could find the copy of generated grammar, optimized grammar and python like program.
* `/D:\02.Git Repository\Pythin-like-dsl-replication-package-dev\PythonicDSL/Class_Diagram_of_The_Metamodel_of_DemoDSL.png`
	- This is the class diagram of the example (i.e., a lightweight embedded system).
* `/D:\02.Git Repository\Pythin-like-dsl-replication-package-dev\PythonicDSL\org.xtext.demo.mydsl\src\org\xtext\demo\mydsl\MyDsl.xtext` 
	- this is the grammar definition file.
	
Please note that D: is the disk in my computer which is as an example, as a reader you could clone the project to anywhere on your computer as you want.
